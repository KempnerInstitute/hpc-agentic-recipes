**Pipeline parallelism disables speculative decoding.** vLLM rejects a speculative config when
pipeline parallelism is in use, so no MTP or draft-model speedup is available in any recipe that needs
PP to span nodes, even when the checkpoint ships an MTP head. SGLang can run TP8 across two nodes with EAGLE
speculative decoding instead, where vLLM would need PP and therefore lose it. The guard is not visible in vLLM 0.25.1's config source, so treat it as behavior
for this version rather than a documented API contract, and re-check after an engine upgrade.

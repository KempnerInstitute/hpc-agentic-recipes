**FlashInfer must be 0.6.15, and its version check must be bypassed.** vLLM 0.25.1 pins
flashinfer-python 0.6.13, but the sm_120 attention backend passes a `kv_scale_format` argument that
0.6.13 does not accept, which fails at the first inference request. Install 0.6.15 with `--no-deps`
so torch is left untouched. No matching 0.6.15 cubin package exists, so `flashinfer-cubin` stays at
0.6.13 and `env/env.sh` sets `FLASHINFER_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1`; kernels are then compiled from
source on first launch, which is why the first request after a fresh environment is slow.

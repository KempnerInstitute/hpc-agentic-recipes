**The sm_120 JIT needs a complete CUDA 13.0 toolkit, and it must not reach `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.** The
node's `/usr/local/cuda-13` is runtime-only, and the fragmented pip nvcc wheels mix 13.0 and 13.2
between `nvcc`, `cicc`, and `ptxas`, which breaks the JIT. The recipe installs a consistent toolkit
via conda. `env/env.sh` points `CUDA_HOME` at it and exposes its headers through `CPATH` and
`LIBRARY_PATH` for compilation only. Do **not** add its libraries to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: its
`libcudart` shadows torch's CUDA 13 runtime and pulls in a `libcupti.so.13` that is not present,
which breaks import entirely.
